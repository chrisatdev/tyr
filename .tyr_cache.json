The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",

In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state.

The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website.

The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport', 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.",
